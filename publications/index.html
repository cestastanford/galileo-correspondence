<p>The Galileo Correspondence Project will have two published outcomes: a scholarly monograph, provisionally titled Galileo's Letters: Experiments in Friendship, about science, silence, friendship, and collegiality as seen through Galileo's correspondence, and a digitally published enriched database of the metadata and content of Galileo's letters.  This database will be a fundamental tool, a new kind of scholarly edition, that will promote further digital humanities analysis and research on this important source base. </p>
