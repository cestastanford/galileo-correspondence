            <h3>Galileo Correspondence Project</h3>
            <p>The Galileo Correspondence Project is a collaborative digital humanities research initiative to create a rich database from the work of a team of graduate student researchers, directed by Paula Findlen and Hannah Marcus, and ultimately a monograph about both the metadata and content of the letters of Galileo Galilei.</p>

The Galileo correspondence is one of the most important and complex scientific correspondences of the early modern era. The letters have a complicated archival history, involving multiple episodes of both intentional suppression and accidental loss of key documents.  We are experimenting with digital methods to reconstruct and read this archive and then using those techniques to develop and publish new perspectives on Galileo as a writer and recipient of letters, scientific and otherwise, who pioneered the use of epistolary as a primary means of communicating controversial ideas and observations.
